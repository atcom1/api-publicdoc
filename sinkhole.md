# Sinkhole Data

Sinkhole event data is generated by our "listen-only" machines, which simply listen and store all data payloads that are sent to them. These payloads will many times refer to what other scanners are probing.

## Schema

```json
{
   "target":{
      "port":"int",
      "ip":"string",
      "protocol":"string"
   },
   "data":{
      "payload":"string"
   },
   "origin":{
      "client_id":"string",
      "ip":"string",
      "type":"string",
      "ts":"int"
   }
}
```

### Contents of the fields:

* **origin**: Information about the origin of the payload, i.e, source remote machine that sent the payload
  * **ip**: IP address of the source of the payload
  * **port**: Port of the source of the payload
  * **type**: Static field, always "sinkhole", meant to distinguish from other events
  * **client_id**: Static field, always "sinkhole", meant to distinguish from other events

* **target**: Information about the target of the payload, i.e, our machine that received the payload
  * **ip**: IP address of the destination of the payload
  * **port**: Port of the destination of the payload
  * **protocol**: Protocol of the destination of the payload (currently TCP only)

* **payload**: Raw data that was sent and captured. No additional processing.

## Event Example

```json
{
   "target":{
      "port":22,
      "ip":"188.166.92.187",
      "protocol":"tcp"
   },
   "data":{
      "payload":"SSH-2.0-libssh2_1.7.0\\r\\n"
   },
   "origin":{
      "client_id":"sinkhole",
      "ip":"24.249.200.182",
      "type":"sinkhole",
      "ts":1538667592640
   }
}
```
